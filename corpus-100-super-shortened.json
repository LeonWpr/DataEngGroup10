{"author":"canamrock","body":"While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that.\n\nLesson 1: Play Well Individually\n\nThis is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap.\n\nYou may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake.\n\nLesson 2: Play Your Team\n\nOne thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided.\n\nObvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention.\n\nAt a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight.\n\n\ntl;dr:\n\nA 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans.

{"author":"gloriously_offtopic","body":"This reminds me of this gal I met in Atlanta, Georgia. She was cute with emerald eyes, and seemed to be very into me. I decided I would do well with my A-game deployed. All I had to do was be quiet, nod from time to time, and smile occasionally.\n\nI know myself very well; when I start talking, the vaginas within earshot tend to dry out like smeared boogers under a computer chair. My methods may seem out of the ordinary, but I have learned to trust and depend on my looks. My soul is ugly, but she won't notice as long as I keep a lid on it.\n\nThe night goes well and she is all over my arm. I am still quiet and sometimes I have to deftly tuck my dong under my belt to avoid being mistaken as some jerk. We decide her place is where we'll go and off we went. This night my luck would change!\n\nWe get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice. No big deal, at least she had a tidy place. We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player. Started kissing, and other stuff adults are notorious for.\n\nAs I am getting some neck, her iguana climbs slowly on to my back. (She lets it roam free; this explains the odor.) \"Oh look! It's Q-Ball!\" She says cheerfully. She grabs him off of my back and his claws scratch me all to hell. \"Uhh. Hello there, Q-Ball...\" I said concealing my irritation. We stop making out and she delivers a lengthy introduction to the huge lizard. I'm pretty sure Q-Ball knows my name, favorite color, and birthday at this point.\n\n\"Wanna feed him!?\" she asked enthusiastically. \"Yeah, that'd be cool!\" I replied as genuinely as I could. No one appreciates being cock-blocked by a reptile. It's not like I felt inadequate, I know damn well I can please a woman better than some scaly tree crawler. We fed Q-Ball chunks of squash and that's when she dropped the bomb on me.\n\n\"He really likes you. But we can't do anything tonight. Q-Ball has been with me a long time and he's got my six. We should wait and get to know each other better first. I'm sure you understand.\" she said. I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek. \"Of course I understand. I'm glad you have a friend in Q-Ball.\" I said rather convincingly.\n\nWe've been dating for a few months now and just last night I finally got to seal the deal with her. She was amazing in bed!

Why would Monsanto HR being using a Skype number? Wouldn't they just use many of the freely available lines at their corporate headquarters, or maybe actually use the corporate headquarters HR phone number:  ?\n\nNow I will applaude you for removing any personal identifying information from Google tied to the main number you listed, you even removed your name from your Amazon store. You really made sure that if anyone googled the phone number you had listed in the forum there, that no-one would be able to find anything through Google that tied back to your real name. \n\nSo sad. \n\nHere's the issue, you didn't think to check Bing. And your name is definitely *not* Rick. It rhymes with \"Noahs Ark\" ;-) and you appear to be in High School. Oh, and you enjoy soccer. \n\nNow, that's not the only problem. Your other problem is you didn't take two seconds to google who's *actually* in charge of Monsanto's social media. I do like how you went Jews all the way down, all the names are jews (LOL). However, a quick trip to google reveals that the Director of Social Media is not a Jewish man, but an blond Italian looking middle-aged woman:  you didn't even get the sex right (ROFL).  BTW, the actual head Monsanto's \"Internet Relations\" is not a Jewish woman, it's actually this guy:  (ROFL X 2!). \n\nThat's who's *actually* in charge. In fact, searching LinkedIN (which 99% of professionals now-a-days have a LinkedIn profile) finds no reference to a \"Rick Bergmann\" working for Mansanto anywhere. In fact **none** of the people you have listed, actually seem to work for Mansanto. \n\nAlso, feel free to search LinkedIn, but there's not one social media personal named \"Rick Bergmann\" in social media listed on LinkedIn. This scenario is highly unlikely. Considering most people hired to be a Social Media Director, have profiles everywhere. \n\nTL;DR: You might want to actually take two seconds and check to see at least if your story has *some* facts before trying to bait a bunch of Skeptics. \n\nSo much time spent on the style sheet, so much time setting up your profile to build \"cred\" with /r/conspiratard, and you couldn't be bothered with checking to see if the people you listed, actually work for Mansanto? /facepalm.

{"author":"DancesWithDaleks","body":"I've long said that Twilight is a tragic case of an awesome plot and a shitty author. \n\nCaution: Spoiler warning!\n\n**Twilight**: Girl falls in love with a vampire whose coven abstains from human blood. Her blood is particularly tempting to him, so every moment they spend together puts him in great pain and her in great danger. When a passing vampire decides to use Bella for a sadistic game, he convinces her he's kidnapped her mother and she goes willingly to him. He starts beating her up by throwing her around in a ballet studio and bites her, only to be saved at the last minute by Edward and his family. Edward sucks the venom out so he doesn't condemn her to immortality. Oh, and he can read minds but not hers and their first date is a result of him saving her from rapists.\n\n**New Moon**: We learn that her best friend Jacob is a werewolf and that the shape-shifting of his tribe stems from an ancient rivalry between his tribe and the vampires, though they have a treaty with the Cullens. In an effort to keep her safe from potential danger of vampires Edward leaves, and Jacob becomes her rock through the ensuing depression. Bella starts taking risks to get an adrenaline rush and \"see\" Edward. When she jumps off a cliff for that reason, his future-seeing seeing sister believes she has killed herself. Bella must fly to Italy and stop him from stepping into the sun so that he will be killed but the \"kings\" of the vampire world, a cult-like ancient group called the Volturi. Edward then returns with Bella so as not to lose her again.\n\n**Eclipse**: The sadistic vampire that Edward killed in the first book had a mate, who has been creating an army of volatile newborn vampires in Seattle to come and kill Bella to avenge her mate. The Cullens have an uneasy alliance with the werewolves to protect her, and the Volturi allow the army to come. We learn about their political motivation and their desire to take the super-powered Cullens and use them for further control. The newborn army is defeated and Bella cuts herself to distract Victoria (the vamp girlfriend) so that Edward can defeat her. Not even getting into the love triangle between Jacob, Bella, and Edward.\n\n**Breaking Dawn**: They get married and she experiences a hyperspeed pregnancy where the incompatible fetus is draining the nutrition from her body, forcing her to drink blood to sustain herself. The baby kills her during birth, but she is saved at the last minute by Edward's venom. Believing that the child is an \"immortal child\" (dangerous vampires that stay children and are killed on sight) rather than a half-vampire child, the Volturi are coming to slaughter the Cullens. They must gather witnesses to make the Volturi hear them out: vampire friends from all over the word.

{"author":"FireinMI","body":"This is what I would love to be the post-season in college football.  The bowl games are still below these 2 tournaments and the losers in the first 2 rounds drop down into bowl games.  These 2 tournaments are the national championship tournament (Tournament of Roses, ToR) and a kind of NIT with the next best teams (Orange Bowl Invitational Tournament, OBIT).  There are just a few simple selection rules that I followed to come up with this field.\n\n1.Every conference champion of a conference with at least 8 teams gets to participate in the ToR.  The left over slots are decided by the BCS rankings.  The OBIT field is determined by the highest 8 teams in the BCS that did not get into the ToR.\n\n2.Teams from the same conference cannot play each other in the first 2 rounds (this affectively limits a conference’s participation to 4 teams in the ToR and 2 additional teams in the OBIT).\n\n3.If a team participates in their conference’s championship game and lose, they cannot move behind a team from their own division that is ranked behind the participating team leading into the conference championship game (This year, Georgia cannot move behind Florida because Georgia was ranked higher than Florida heading into the SECCG).\n\nFormat: The first 2 rounds of both tournaments are single elimination and are hosted by the higher seed.  The winners of the 2 bracket pools of the OBIT advance to the Orange Bowl.  The 4 winners of the bracket pools of the ToR are re-seeded (highest seed left plays lowest seed left, 2nd highest seed left plays 2nd lowest seed left) regardless of conference.  The highest seed left in the tournament then chooses which semi-final bowl game their semi-final will be (Fiesta Bowl or Sugar Bowl).  The winners of the Fiesta Bowl and Sugar Bowl advance to the Rose Bowl National Championship Game.\n\nOther: This post season structure would not work with our current model of a 13th conference championship game so in order for this to happen divisional conferences would need to have a sort of cross over last week so that all the teams are playing the week before the tournament would start.  Also, all teams would have to play 12 games in the first 13 weeks, then week 14 and 15 would be the 1st and 2nd round of the tournament.  There would then be a final exams break and then the semifinal/other bowls/Orange Bowl would happen followed by at least a week break and then the Rose Bowl Final.  Before people say that 16 games is too many, I would just like to point out that under the current system USC is going to play 13 regular season games next year (due to going to Hawaii) and if they make the Pac12CG and a bowl they will play in 15 games.  Then, starting in 2014 if a team goes to Hawaii they could play 16 games if they play 13 regular season, their conf. championship, the semi-final, and the Final.\n \nTLDR; 16 team NCAA Tournament and 8 team NIT tournaments including conference champions.

On the last day of summer school, we stayed behind after classes were done, and sat on one of the buildings and just talked and watched the empty field. We had an amazing kiss and afterward she told me she loved me. She was the first girl to ever tell me that. We kept dating in the school year, but for a couple of younger kids, going to separate schools and only seeing each other about twice a month got too hard, and around Christmas we broke up. It was kinda rough going but I got through it. \n The next summer we started hanging out more and decided to get back together again. Thing were pretty good until one day when she got super mad at me for not calling her back to go to an evanescence concert. What had happened was she phoned my house and my sister picked up and took a message. One that she never passed on. Despite all that, we had a pretty big fight, and broke up again. \n I had just started to get over it again when I logged into facebook one day and I see her best friends status: \"R.I.P (ex's name), I'll miss you\". I emailed her, and she told me that my ex had committed suicide, and when the funeral was. She was 16. 6 years later and I still don't know how it happened or if there was a note or anything. Just that she's gone. My parents were supportive, giving me my space, but mostly I just kind of shut down in the time between my initial breakdown and the funeral. I went and got bought a suit, I got driven to the the funeral and sat in the pew and listened to her cousin tell stories from when she was a little girl. It was actually one of the best eulogies I've ever heard. I almost managed to hold it together until they played the funeral dirge. \"My Immortal\". I just remembered the concert and the fight and I just broke down again. I spent the rest of high school getting over her, and I couldn't even listen to \"My Immortal\" until 2 years after I'd graduated.","content_len":582,"summary":"Had my first love in summer school, on-off relationship for about 2 years.

{"author":"CthulhuFerrigno","body":"As a mental health counselor, I can attest that this has less to do with depression than it does anxiety. Some of the best techniques for treating anxiety are to confront those fears directly through imagined or in-vivo experiments, much like the one the author alluded to about the subway. This is called exposure therapy. Our brains, for whatever reason (evolutionary or otherwise) are predisposed to process negative information first and foremost. For example, in a group with my clients I may ask them \"what went wrong today?\" and they'd supply their answers. Then I would ask them \"what went right?\" What they don't realize is that this isn't about the content of their answers; I'm actually timing them in my mind to see how quickly they respond. 9 times out of 10 they can supply the negative much more quickly than the positive. Because we are predisposed to avoid negative outcomes, we come to avoid any situations which may lead to negative outcomes, and thus an anxiety disorder may result (agoraphobia, social anxiety, etc.). \n     Depression, on the other hand, is more about negativistic vs. realistic but hopeful thinking. As the author suggests, if we could just \"think positive\" and alleviate our depression I'd be out of a job. The problem is that overly positive thinking does not ring true for us, and so it does not take hold for us emotionally. For example, I could walk around telling myself \"I will succeed at everything I try\", but 1) as a realist I don't actually believe that, and 2) even if I did I'd be in for a rude awakening on a daily basis. The irony is that it is just as silly for me to say to myself \"I will fail at everything I try\", but not only am I more likely to believe this (as negatives such as past failures are more easily retrieved from memory as evidence), but also this syncs with my emotional state (sadness/self-loathing) and so I may then allow this thought to take hold and drag myself deeper into the spiral of depression. Both thoughts are outlandish, but the negative one is more likely to impact us, and that is a key point in terms of depression. Only through meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking) can we work to catch ourselves when we begin to think this way, and substitute realistic and hopeful alternative thoughts such as \"I will have my successes and my failures, but even in failure I can succeed by learning from my mistakes\". Counselors and therapists do not teach depressed clients to ignore all the negatives, they teach clients to acknowledge and appreciate the positives they have long been ignoring.\n\nTL;DR - Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown.

Foghat: still probably touring somewhere in Des Moines.) True, our Sun will last somewhere in the ~10 billion year range, but the very massive stars may only last about 1 million years - i.e. 10,000 times shorter lifespan than our Sun. There's plenty of time for lots of those to have occurred over the age of our universe.\n\n3) Only large stars (about 5 times the mass of our Sun) end in the explosive Type II supernovae and seed a wide portion of the rest of the galaxy with heavy elements. Smaller than that, our Sun included, and stars will end as planetary nebulae, quietly shedding only their outer hydrogen layers to the small local neighborhood.\n\n4) It's only in supernovae that the really heavy elements are produced.

He did not take my rejection very well. \n What did he do?: He would follow me home in his car (I walked home) for about 3 years, he told the entire school that I was his girlfriend (he had an actual girlfriend, too, of whom he did not refer to as his girlfriend), and he would just ogle at me whenever he saw me, but wouldn't really speak to me. Oh, and he would pick fights out of nowhere with my boyfriend and escalate them to the point of getting both himself and my boyfriend sent to the principal's office. \n He still contacts me from time to time, but always acts like it was an accident. He asked me out when I was a sophomore in high school. I am now a senior in college. I think he may have some problems. \n TL;DR Most popular guy in school asks me out, I reject, he follows me around and annoys my boyfriend. \n","content":"Yes.

{"author":"kubed_zero","body":"Here we are!\nEdit: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger! Also, the OP is updated, so this is useless now =)\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThat is a very complicated question but, I'll see if I can hit some of the basics for you.\n\nFirst you need to know what hacking is\n\n    Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.\n\nSo in layman's terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these \"flaws\"? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software. I'll try to give a decent example of each.\n\nHuman: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don't practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as \"social engineering\". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books.\n\nNow an example, Let's say I work for company XYZ and my manager is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn't logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don't want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don't know his password to get back in! That's when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won't know best security practices and, I'm certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can't login. I'm in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I'm sure of it. So, I tell him that I'm Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell \"Shit, It's almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don't have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say 'you're fired', you understand me?\" Now a normal worker wouldn't fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let's see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don't have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.\n\nHardware:\n\nI want access to somebody's documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don't though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn't ask for a password but, let's be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers? Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up!\n\nSoftware:\n\nSoftware is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling \"sql injection\", \"Javascript Injection\", \"DDOS\", \"bruteforce hacking\", \"URL Manipulation\" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don't have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I'll try to give a brief example though.\n\nI was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because \"I was about to die\". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He's not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails. This program will cycle through all the upper case and lower case letters and all numbers, hitting every combination possible until it succeeds. With people who have long passwords or passwords with special characters this could take a long time, maybe even years. However most people don't use complicated passwords, especially on online games. If this website followed good security practices they would limit the amount of login attempts possible from a certain IP address in a certain period of time or lock an account with to many incorrect login attempts. Unfortunately the creators of this game did no such thing. I head to the kitchen to fix myself some french bread pizza and wait. In a little over an hour I hear a beeping noise, the sound I programmed it to make when it succeeded. I head back to my computer and there it is. I'm logged in to his account! First things first, I open up another tab in my browser and log in to my account on the game. I then trade all of his best items over to my character, along with all his gold and anything else that looks useful. I could have deleted his character but I decided that him seeing the character without all of the items and money he had collected would be much more entertaining. Finishing up, I log out and continue on about my day with a smile on my face. Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 3) Read this\n\nTL;DR- They take advantage of stupid people, bad security and their own knowledge of computers and programming.\n\n\n","normalizedBody":"Here we are!\nEdit: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger!

Mission accomplished! \n Hacking lesson - 3) Read this \n TL;DR- They take advantage of stupid people, bad security and their own knowledge of computers and programming. \n","content":"Here we are!\nEdit: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger! Also, the OP is updated, so this is useless now =) \n +++++++++++++++++++++++ \n That is a very complicated question but, I'll see if I can hit some of the basics for you. \n First you need to know what hacking is \n Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.\n \n So in layman's terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these \"flaws\"? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software. I'll try to give a decent example of each. \n Human: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don't practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as \"social engineering\". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books. \n Now an example, Let's say I work for company XYZ and my manager is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn't logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don't want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don't know his password to get back in! That's when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won't know best security practices and, I'm certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can't login. I'm in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I'm sure of it. So, I tell him that I'm Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell \"Shit, It's almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don't have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say 'you're fired', you understand me?\" Now a normal worker wouldn't fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let's see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don't have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished! \n Hacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them. \n Hardware: \n I want access to somebody's documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don't though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn't ask for a password but, let's be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers? Mission accomplished! \n Hacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up! \n Software: \n Software is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling \"sql injection\", \"Javascript Injection\", \"DDOS\", \"bruteforce hacking\", \"URL Manipulation\" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don't have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I'll try to give a brief example though. \n I was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because \"I was about to die\". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He's not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen.

Is there a time limit you're here for? A quick stalk of your username makes me think you are in Connecticut. I want to give you beer places but if you can't wait till tomorrow for the full write-up:\n\n**Big Dog's Draft House**\n\n**Ellis Island Casino and Brewery** (cheap beer, but GOOD cheap beer)\n\n**The Public House** (In the Venetian. Don't get me started on the one in the Luxor.)\n\n**Aces and Ales**\n\n**Todd English's P.U.B.** in Crystals Mall at the City Center (it touches the Aria)&lt;---Note: Can you chug a beer in under 7 seconds? They'll let you have 1 pint free if you can. As I understand it, that applies to any beer you want, so have at it. Pro Tip: The beer can't leave the counter until the timer starts, but that doesn't mean your lips can't be hovering a millimeter over that sucker right before they let you start.\n\n**Freakin' Frog**. I saw someone say service sucked/overpriced/Yard House has \"more\" beers. For me: Service has always been above excellent, especially on slower nights in the middle of the week when you can talk beer with the bartenders/no more overpriced then anywhere else on or near the strip/Yard House has more DRAFT beers. Freakin' Frog is home to 1,000 beers and has a literal Beer Bible (binder) for you to choose from. Ask them to let you check out their fridge, it's beautiful. If you like Whiskey at all, it is also home to the largest selection of Whiskey in North America upstairs and the owner (a professor at UNLV) gives a class on a tasting technique that is amazing. I'm not kidding. I don't like whiskey and this guy's technique made me like it.

{"author":"laxweasel","body":"This is a well written post and I don't know your purpose so I'll try to address a few things.\nFIRST: the work of Suzanne Gordon and a few others. She shows how everything from cost cutting to our portrayal in the media is hurting nursing. When I'm at home I can compile a book list.\n\n1. The image of nursing: take a look at media portrayals of nursing. Most are foils or sidekicks to more interesting and important doctor characters. Medical shows show doctors doing things that are nursing responsibility that no doctor would ever do. Even the positive portrayals reinforce the \"angel of mercy\" image of our job... The emotional, sensitive, caring touch that is portrayed as intuitive to caring people, not involving skill or education. Have you ever seen a nurse leader? A nurse researcher? A CRNA or NP? A nurse expertly running a code? Nope. This reinforces to the public that we are sweet and caring, not technically skilled and highly educated.\n\n2. Nursing's place in the healthcare team: we are both not respected for our expertise and expected to be jack of all trades.  We all know that in many places and environments medical education is slow to adopt a true teamwork attitude. I see no reason to harp on this. Many physicians see themselves not as a part of the team but supreme dictator. Many are not trained or encouraged to value or recognize our expertise. The good ones come to recognize this on their own.\nAt the same time, most of us have had the experience of needing to fill multiple roles. Because when there are staffing and budget cuts, it falls to nursing. No one to clean the rooms or stretchers? No social worker to arrange transport? No tech to stock your supplies? No NA or PCT to help feed or turn or check sugars? No phlebotomy? The answer is always the nurse. More and more *our role as the last line of patient advocacy is being manipulated to unsafely increase our workload and responsibility*.  Nurses are managing sicker and sicker patients and accepting more and more responsibility without necessarily giving up any to other healthcare team members.\n\n3. The changing nature of health and illness in the county: the push to decrease he level of care with sicker and sicker patients leaves us taking care of more. The patients who would've been in the ICU for weeks are going to the floors sooner and sooner, and floors to home or nursing facilities sooner. It's a push to save money but it pushes high acuity onto people already at strained nurse to patient ratios.\n\n4. The money push: nurses, especially good nurses, are not \"money makers\" for hospitals the way a good surgeon can be. They do not independently charge for services, and are viewed as a cost of running a facility. Therefore they are manipulated to \"maximum efficiency\" in terms of patient ratios and workload. However because the way maximum efficiency is measured is mostly by some rather arbitrary and certainly not all-encompassing metrics, administrators cannot be convinced of the value of decreasing patient ratios so RNs can give \"good care\". Also see above, the push is to put patients in lower acuity (read: less costly nursing care) as soon as possible without any costly adverse events.\n\n5. Moral distress: this is a huge factor of burnout in many nurses. Most of us just really want to give good care to our patients. We could choose a more glamourous job, an easier one, a better paying one... But we really want to take care of our patients. However we are shackled and every turn. We have to fight to use our judgment and get a physician order for practically everything, even when we know better than them. We have to fight to keep even our wretched staffing ratios. We have to take over the jobs of other team members like techs and case managers when their jobs are slashed from the budget. We have to document and double document to make our employers covered from lawsuits (and ourselves) and to prove we are meeting core measures.  At the end of the day we often don't feel like we had enough time to do everything we wanted to do for our patients. Add to that the stress from difficult patients and the other problems listed and you see why people burn out. You get into the job to do the right thing and give excellent care, and you can't. Not because you don't have the skills, or the drive. It's the barriers put in your way, the other responsibilities pulling you in a million different directions. And it's WRONG and you KNOW IT. It hurts you that you couldn't be in the room with your comfort care patient and family but you had to prep your other patient and take them to the cath lab and you STILL stayed an hour late to finish your paperwork. It eventually burns your emotional reserve.\n\n6. Nursing culture/a united nurse front: our infighting and problems are no secret. \"Eat your young\" culture in what is still a heavily apprenticeship based profession is our own poison pill. As listed, we have enough going against us, we need to stick together if we want to survive.  Additionally, as a profession we cannot even present a united front on our own education and standards. We can't agree on how to get into our field so how the heck can we present a united front to fight powerful organizations that are causing the problems I listed? A powerful, dominant physician culture? Highly profitable insurance companies? Corporation backed, money-first administration? As a profession we are challenged and what do we do? Complain about burned out old nurses, know-nothing new nurses, being forced to get a BSN, not getting with the times with an ADN. And physician dominance, insurance profits, healthcare facility corporations have been cashing in on our bitter infighting and probably watching with glee the fact that we can't get ourselves together enough to give them a fair fight.\n\nI didn't cover everything, but I feel this gives a good overview of the issues we have.\n\nTl;dr: we got issues.","normalizedBody":"This is a well written post and I don't know your purpose so I'll try to address a few things.\nFIRST: the work of Suzanne Gordon and a few others.

{"author":"fat_over_lean","body":"This is going to be a rambling post of my 40k history and armies so bear with me.\n\nI got into 40k like this: One of my friends fathers was heavily invested into 40k/Fantasy- I'm talking 3000+ points of every army (painted and heavily converted to boot). Their entire basement was full of glass cases of armies. I believe he used to work in a GW store and as a Rogue Trader. Anyways, my friends and I were all fascinated by the models and so after some test games we each chose an army to play. \n\nI ended up choosing Tyranids (3rd ed) simply because I thought they looked cool. I racked up about 1500 points before realizing that I preferred shooty armies. I ended up repainting them several times, and lost a lot of the detail. My friend who originally started with Tau decided to switch to Eldar, and so I jumped on the opportunity to take up the Tau reigns. I decided to sell the the 'nids in 4th edition, with the intent to try out Ulthwe Eldar. I sold the 'nids for a good price to someone in Australia, but the post down under lost the package for 6 months. I had to refund the money, and was very close to receiving insurance money for more than I sold them for. However, the Australia post eventually located the package months later (which was now completely crushed, including all of my miniatures) and the person I sold it to returned it to me. USPS wouldn't pay anything for the damage, and I ended up reselling them at 30% of what I had originally sold them for.\n\nWith the 'nid money, I did buy an Eldar Battleforce and a Seer Council, but ended up not having the funds to expand them or any interest in battling with them. At this point I had actually begun several armies, none of which were completely painted. I decided I should refocus my efforts back into finishing my main, the Tau. I sold them and put the money towards the 4th ed Tau boxed army.\n\nI am a Tau addict and ended up with probably 4000 points, maybe even 5000 or more (haven't done a total tally in years). I have so many Kroot that I also have a fully converted 1500pt Kroot Kindred army that I used to play for fun (back when Chapter Approved was around). Oddly enough the Kroot was the only army I finished since they were so easy to paint.\n\nMy brother liked the Space Marines, and so to get him into the game I basically went halfsies with him building (and painting) a Salamanders army when the Armageddon Codex came out. I have roughly 3000 points of them, with another 1000 points of unpainted SM that I'm not sure if I want to use to flush out the Sallies or convert them into more...\n\n...Pre-Heresy Thousand sons. I have a small army of them, probably 1000, maybe 1500 if I load up on Wargear. I also have another 1000 points of post-heresy 1k Sons.

However they are currently on the backburner as I am (still) trying to finish my Tau.\n\nI ended up being a pretty decent painter, and spent my free time in HS building/painting armies on commission. 40k: Crimson fists, CSM Khorne, IG, WHFB: Dwarves, Goblins. That means most of my personal armies were never finished. By the time I was heading to college (2006), my armies were still incomplete and I no longer had time to work on them. I brought them to school with me, but didn't even touch them. That was until this year, when I saw that 6th ed had just come out and bought the rulebook.

I also bought a few hundred dollars worth of paints, and all of the current codexes (on ebay). I don't know what I was thinking, considering my other armies weren't even done. On top of that, I got a case of the WAAAGH and wanted to paint the 5th ed starter Orks first (as bad moons). I made myself commit to finishing the Orks before moving on to anything else.

I brought them to school with me, but didn't even touch them. That was until this year, when I saw that 6th ed had just come out and bought the rulebook. Now I had time and disposable income and decided to get back into 40k with a college friend. \n I got a little too excited, and since July I went ahead and bought another 1000 points of Tau, a 2000 point (unpainted) Eldar army, along with Ltd Ed Dark Vengeance and the 5th ed starter. I also bought a few hundred dollars worth of paints, and all of the current codexes (on ebay). I don't know what I was thinking, considering my other armies weren't even done. On top of that, I got a case of the WAAAGH and wanted to paint the 5th ed starter Orks first (as bad moons). I made myself commit to finishing the Orks before moving on to anything else. They're actually almost done! \n Before my hiatus I also decided to experiment with Fantasy and have about 2000 points of Lizardmen, and maybe 500 points of Brettonians. I only ever played one game, and didn't really enjoy it as much as 40k. I also dabbled in the specialist games. I have a Van Saar gang, a small Cawdor gang, and a converted Lizardmen blood bowl team.","content_len":832,"summary":"Minus a 6 year hiatus, I've been collecting since 3rd edition. 4000-5000 points of Tau (not including 1500 points of Kroot Kindred), 3000 of Salamanders, 1000 of Pre-Heresy, 1000 of post-heresy 1k Sons, 2000 Ulthwe Eldar, 500(?)

{"author":"Zamboniman","body":"&gt;Here's the basics: my view is that an underlying force/energy allows the universe's physical properties to exist and function.\n\nIf by this you mean we do not yet fully understand the strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity and how they unify in enough detail to create a Grand Unified Theory, then I'd agree with you. With the exception of gravity however, we do have an approximation of their interactions as described by perturbation theory, which partially describes how gauge bosons may be exchanged between particles. Unfortunately, there *are* things we don't know, or rather that this does not describe. Like bound states and solitons.\n\nBut what of it? Conjecture is not evidence. Nor is it descriptive, predictive, or particularly useful in any way in the observed nature of the universe.\n\n&gt;If a Deity exists or does not, it is unproven as of yet.\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt;Atheists have a theory that one (or more) does not exist because nothing has been observed by people.\n\nI can only speak for myself, but I have a *reasonable hypothesis* (not a theory) that it is *unlikely in the extreme* due to utter and complete lack of any evidence that would lead anyone to that conclusion. Just as I have a *reasonabe hypothesis* that it is *unlikely in the extreme* that flying pink unicorns from planet Biggledyboop hide my car keys in the couch cushions sometimes, due to the exact and precise same utter and complete lack of evidence for them.\n\n&gt;The flipside of this is that I see a universe with complexity and that is a good indication that something is beyond our senses is happening which led to the universe's state of previous, current, and future existence. \n\nWe all are already aware of many things that are happening beyond our senses. Fortunately, we have empirical information of those things that have led us to study, learn, and eventually devise instruments to detect some of this for us. There are many, many complex things we do not know yet. We continue to try and learn more.\n\n&gt;The atheist will argue that there is no need to bring a deity into discussion since it may have occurred on its own.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThere is no need. Occam's Razor is a rather large issue.\n\n&gt;But I am bothered why some are opposed to me saying that I believe a Deity did have a role. No 100% proof either way.\n\nBecause, quite simply, you create far more problems than you solve with such an outlandish proposition. First, why posit such a thing without any evidence whatsoever? Even more, why posit something without any evidence when instead of solving your problem, it *actually makes it far worse?*\n\nYou now are left with more questions than you started with. Where did this deity come from? What are its properties? Why does it exist? How can we determine its existence? If we cannot, then why does it make any sense at all hypothesize such an entity? Something that has no measurable effect on anything is the same as something that doesn't exist in every way.\n\n&gt;My question is why so many are against me having my views when either reasoning carries similar weight. Nobody has proven anything.\n\nBecause if you believe hypothesizing unevidenced and unhelpful solutions that actually highly complicate an issue but solve nothing, predict nothing, and determine nothing can possibly *carry similar weight* then you have much to learn.\n\nThis illogical, unevidenced, unhelpful, contradictory, unexplained, non-predictive, non-measurable, non-specific and rather bizarre idea *cannot* carry any weight *whatsoever* to anybody actually interested in actually knowing.\n\ntl;dr: Because it's balderdash.
